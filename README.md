### Dock clean up

As I find the default MacOS dock is cluttered, this playbook will also remove the following from the dock:
- Keynote
- Numbers
- Pages
- Freeform
- Contacts
- Maps
- Mail
- Messages
- Notes
- TV
- App Store
- Safari
- System Settings
- FaceTime

 
## What could be considered missing?

Currently, I have no need for the following packages and thus I have omitted them

- Docker
- Kubernetes
